<p>One thing about <a href="http://www.tomatojos.net/08-tomato-paste-processing/">tomato paste</a> is that it needs a lot of tomatoes to make. Tomatoes are about 95% water and 5% solids/sugar. The next time you reach for that can of tomato puree, check the concentrate percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Probably, the label will read <em>“dual concentrate”</em> and the merchandise will contain about 28% solid materials (also called Brix). So if you’re making paste, you will need 5.6kgs of tomatoes with a 5% sugars content to make 1kg of tomato paste at 28% Brix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Tomato_paste_on_spoon.jpg/800px-Tomato_paste_on_spoon.jpg?1538136946250" alt="tomato paste"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two types of tomato paste - <strong>Hot Break and Cold Break,</strong> and they're used to get different end products. To create Hot Break (HB) paste, the new tomatoes must be warmed soon after chopping to a high temperature (ranging from 85 to 100°C).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cold Break (CB) paste requires the fresh, cut tomatoes to be heated at a lesser temperature (which ranges from 65 to 75°C).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HB paste is usually used for ketchup and various types of tomato sauce needing a 28-30° Brix, while CB paste is used for triple concentrate paste at 36-38° Brix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomato paste processing need a continual way to obtain fresh tomatoes, which is quite crucial for the tomato control series to operate at maximum capacity constantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If capacity drops below a certain threshold, or worse even, if paste can't be made at all in a day, then the process needs to halt while all the equipment is cleaned properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dbog4ab30"><strong>Steps required for tomato paste processing.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Fresh tomatoes in the trucks is taken to the offloading area. An operator, utilizing a special tube, sends a huge quantity of water into the pickup truck, so that the tomatoes can flow right out of the opening at the end of the trailer, Using water allows easy movement of tomatoes without damage.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.botswanayouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/paste.jpg" alt="Tomato Factory in Botswana"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Sorting: Water is constantly pumped to transport the tomatoes into roller elevator, rinse them, and then send the tomatoes to the sorting station. In the sorting station, materials besides the tomatoes are removed as well as discoloured, green and damaged tomatoes. This is usually done by hand, but some facilities possess the equipment for automated sorting.</li>
<li>Chopping: The ideal tomatoes are pumped to the chopper area where they will be chopped.</li>
<li>Cool or Hot Break: The pulp is pre-heated to 65-75°C for CH processing or to 85-95°C for HB processing.</li>
<li>Juice Removal: The pulp (comprising fibre, juice, pores and skin and seeds) is then pumped via a removal unit made up of a pulper and a refiner, Typically, 95% of the pulp pass through both sieves. as a result, the remaining 5%, made up of fibre, seeds and skin, is considered waste and is transported from the station to be sold as feed for livestock.</li>
<li>Holding tank: The enhanced juice is collected in a sizable holding tank, which feeds the evaporator constantly.</li>
<li>Evaporation: This is where the water is extracted, and the juice that is still only 5% solid becomes 28% to 36% concentrated tomato paste. The evaporator regulates juice intake and finished concentrate output automatically; the operator only needs to set the Brix value on the control panel for the level of concentration needed.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the juice inside the evaporator goes through different stages, its concentration steadily increases until the required density is obtained in the ultimate “finisher” stage. The complete concentrate/evaporation process occurs under vacuum conditions, at temperatures below 100°C.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote --> <!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Aseptic Filling: Most facilities package the completed product using aseptic bags, consequently the product in the evaporator never makes connection with air before the customer is reached.</li>
<li>The concentrate is delivered from the evaporator right to an aseptic container, it is then pumped through the aseptic sterilizer-cooler (also known as a flash cooler) to the aseptic fillers, Once packed the concentrate can be kept up to two years.</li>
</ul>

<!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some facilities choose to bundle their finished product under non-aseptic conditions, this paste must proceed through another step. It's warmed to pasteurize the paste, and then held under check for two weeks before it goes to the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dbog4ab41">How Expensive is Tomato Paste Processing?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomato paste processing is a capital and energy intensive venture. So when next you have to use a bottle of ketchup or some cooking paste, you’ll know how its processed.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dbm0fl5l5"><strong>Planting</strong></h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dbm0fl5l6">Plant Your Tomato</h3>
<p>The best way to plant your tomato is by first planting it in the nursery, afterwards transplanting to the field.<br>That is done by covering them with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Paivkaf-Agrovet-Enterprise-107251979950185/posts">polyethylene sheet</a> to avoid weed growth, fungus, nematodes, pests, and bacteria. You should look at applying organic fertilizer and manure before planting. Understand that your seed bed ought to be 55-65cm wide, 5-6cm lengthy and 20-25cm high.</p>
<ul>
<li>On how best to plant your tomatoes; tomato planting can be carried out around March/April through the starting of raining period. Plant by putting the tomatoes seeds on the soil and cover with 25 % inch level of soil then press it together with your hands or handle (you might cover it with dried out grasses if you would like. This is to avoid loss of moisture).</li>
<li>After planting, you will notice them growing within the next 5-7 days (after that you can take away the dry grasses to permit for proper growth) then let it grow for about a month or 5 weeks before transplanting to the field.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Your Tomato Nursery can be achieved on a little farm or on your own garden; for those who have one. Ensure that the soil is certainly healthy and looked after well.</p>

<li>On how best to transplant your tomatoes; You should open up the soil of where you intend to transplant with a little bit of small wood, put in the seedling in to the hole and cover it with loose soil. The soil where you would like to transplant your plant ought to be moist.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Take note; after transplant, the seedbeds ought to be irrigated frequently after sowing and before seedlings reach an elevation of 5 to 7 cm. Do not leave it like that, or else, it will die.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dbm0fl5l8">Irrigate Your Tomato Farm</h3>

<ul>
<li>You may use chemical weed control also, through the use of registered chemicals. Likewise, if you plan to use mechanical solutions to weed, it must be shallow rather than too near to the plant; to avoid damages to the vegetation.</li>
<li>Fertilizer ought to be applied following the first weeding. That is to greatly help restock the soil nutrients affected or taken by the weeds. For the most part, the fertilizer must have contents like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, potash, molybdenum, calcium, and magnesium, and also other trace nutrients, all in adequate volume. Tomato requires these nutrients to develop and flourish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dbm0fl5ma">Control Illnesses and Pests in Your Tomato Farm</h3>

<li>Late blight</li>
<li>Erinose mite</li>
<li>Bacterial canker</li>
<li>Thrips</li>
</ol>
<p>These diseases and pests can be managed by;</p>
<ul>
<li>Practicing crop rotation.</li>
<li>Destroying infected plants and discarding them.</li>
<li>Using registered chemicals.</li>
<li>Practicing of proper sanitation.</li>
<li>And controlling drainage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dbm0fl5mb"><strong>Harvesting</strong></h2>
